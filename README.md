<p>This was a team project for school, the main goal was to create an app that allows users to manage game nights. We were given a few user stories that were fulfilled with this app.</p>
<p>It was our first experience with developing an app that includes authentication, database connectivity and real-time synchronization.</p>
<p>Without it being a requirement, we wanted to enable use on iOS and Android and therefore decided to implement it with React Native and Expo. The app is in a development build and can therefore be installed on Android. Unfortunately, this doesn't work on iOS, as it requires a paid Apple developer account.</p>
<p>You can install and try the App on Android with this QR-Code (installation of apps from external sources must be allowed in your system):</p>
